    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <div>
        <div>
            My family moved from Colorado to Florida when I was two years old, and I have lived in Florida for the last 22 years, most of which has been spent in Orlando.
             I went to college at the University of Florida where I received both my Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in Accounting.
            I initially worked full time as a tax analyst at Citibank in Tampa, but I have recently begun work as an auditor at Deloitte
            here in Orlando.

            Two of my main hobbies are video games and working out. I have played video games often since I was in middle school,
            starting with Halo 2, and have also built several PCs for both myself and my friends over the years. I also enjoy
            weightlifting and love seeing the progress I can make over time.

            I hope to learn as much as I can about software development in these next 24 weeks, as I hope to move
            into that field full time!
